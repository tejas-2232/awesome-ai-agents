When evaluating AI models that generate code, you need more than just checking if the response makes sense. You also need to verify that the generated code actually has valid syntax and follows the correct format. This is where code-based grading comes in.

How Code Grading Works
Code grading validates two key aspects of AI-generated responses:

Format - The response should return only the requested code type (Python, JSON, or Regex) without explanations
Valid Syntax - The generated code should actually parse correctly as the intended language
Task Following - The response should directly address what was asked and be accurate
