### Agent Development Kit

* Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks.
* ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.

## Build a multi-tool agent
This quickstart guides you through installing the Agent Development Kit (ADK), setting up a basic agent with multiple tools, and running it locally either in the terminal or in the interactive, browser-based dev UI.

This quickstart assumes a local IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) with Python 3.9+ or Java 17+ and terminal access. This method runs the application entirely on your machine and is recommended for internal development.

1. Set up Environment & Install ADKÂ¶

__Python__
Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):

```python
# Create
python -m venv .venv
# Activate (each new terminal)
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Install ADK:


pip install google-adk
