# Awesome AI Agents

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different types of AI agents with practical, runnable code examples.

## Overview

This repository contains four different AI agent implementations, each showcasing different approaches and capabilities:

1. **Basic Conversational Agent** - Simple chatbot with context awareness
2. **Task-Oriented Agent** - Agent that executes tasks using tools
3. **RAG Agent** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge-based responses
4. **Multi-Agent System** - Multiple agents working together collaboratively

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or create a .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

3. Open any notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
