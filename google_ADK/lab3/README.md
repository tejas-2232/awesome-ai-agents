# Empower ADK agents with tools

### Overview

This lab covers the use of tools with Agent Development Kit agents.

From powerful tools provided by Google, like Google Search and Vertex AI Search, to the rich variety of tools available in the LangChain and CrewAI ecosystems, there are many tools to get started with.

Additionally, creating your own tool from a function only requires writing a good docstring!

> This lab assumes you are familiar with the basics of ADK covered in the lab1: _Get started with Agent Development Kit (ADK)._


## Objective
In this lab, you will learn about the ecosystem of tools available to ADK agents. You will also learn how to provide a function to an agent as a custom tool.

After this lab, you will be able to:

* Provide prebuilt Google, LangChain, or CrewAI tools to an agent
* Discuss the importance of structured docstrings and typing when writing functions for agent tools
* Write your own tool functions for an agent
