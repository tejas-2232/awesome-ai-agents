# Develop an app with Gemini

Overview
In this lab, you use Gemini, an AI-powered collaborator in Google Cloud, to explore, create, modify, test, and deploy a sample app.

You use Cloud Workstations to create a development environment that uses Code OSS as the IDE. You use Gemini Code Assist in Cloud Code to understand code and build a sample inventory app that has two API methods. You also use Gemini to generate the steps for deploying your app to Cloud Run.

This lab is intended for developers of any experience level who contribute to building apps but might not be familiar with cloud application development. It helps to have some experience using VS Code or Code OSS as your IDE and to be familiar with Python and the Flask framework.

Note: Duet AI was renamed to Gemini, our next-generation model. This lab has been updated to reflect this change. Any references to Duet AI in the user interface or documentation should be treated as equivalent to Gemini while following the lab instructions.

> Note: As an early-stage technology, Gemini can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you validate all output from Gemini before you use it. For more information, see Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI.


## Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

* Create a cloud-based application development environment by using Cloud Workstations.
* Explore various Google services that you can use to deploy an app by asking Gemini context-based questions.
* Prompt Gemini to provide templates that you can use to develop a basic app in Cloud Run.
* Create, explore, and modify the app by using Gemini to explain and generate the code.
Run and test the app locally, and then deploy it to Google Cloud by using Gemini to generate the steps.
