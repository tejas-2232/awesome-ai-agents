# Deploy ADK agents to Agent Engine

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn to deploy ADK agents to Agent Engine for a scalable, fully managed environment for your agentic workflows.

This allows you to focus on the agents' logic while infrastructure is allocated and scaled for you.

## Objective

In this lab you will learn:

* The benefits of deploying agents to Agent Engine
* How to grant required roles to the Reasoning Engine Service Agent
* How to deploy an agent to Agent Engine using the ADK command line interface
* How to query an agent deployed to Agent Engine
* How to monitor your deployed agents
* How to delete agents

## Agent Engine
* Vertex AI Agent Engine (formerly known as LangChain on Vertex AI or Vertex AI Reasoning Engine) is a fully managed Google Cloud service enabling developers to deploy, manage, and scale AI agents in production.

* You can learn more about its benefits in the [Vertex AI Agent Engine documentation.](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview)
