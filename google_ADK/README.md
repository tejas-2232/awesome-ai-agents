## Overview: Benefits of Agent Development Kit

Agent Development Kit offers several key advantages for developers building agentic applications:

* Multi-Agent Systems: Build modular and scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents in a hierarchy. Enable complex coordination and delegation.

* Rich Tool Ecosystem: Equip agents with diverse capabilities: use pre-built tools (Search, Code Execution, etc.), create custom functions, integrate tools from third-party agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI), or even use other agents as tools.

* Flexible Orchestration: Define workflows using workflow agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, and LoopAgent) for predictable pipelines, or leverage LLM-driven dynamic routing (LlmAgent transfer) for adaptive behavior.

* Integrated Developer Experience: Develop, test, and debug locally with a powerful CLI and an interactive dev UI. Inspect events, state, and agent execution step-by-step.

* Built-in Evaluation: Systematically assess agent performance by evaluating both the final response quality and the step-by-step execution trajectory against predefined test cases.

* Deployment Ready: Containerize and deploy your agents anywhere â€“ run locally, scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine, or integrate into custom infrastructure using Cloud Run or Docker.
